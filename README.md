**Introduction**
SmartECG is designed to enhance the diagnostic process by leveraging state-of-the-art technologies in artificial intelligence. It focuses on automated classification of patients based on 12-lead ECG images, providing valuable insights into cardiac and COVID-19-related conditions.

**Machine** **Learning** **Algorithm**
Support Vector Machine was used to classify ECG images and got 85% accuracy. Random Forest got 83%  and Decision Tree to classify ECG images got 76% accuracy.

**CNN**
As Convolutional neural networks are more suitable for image classification, CNN architecture with a relu activation function was built, the optimizer was ADAM and the loss calculated was Sparse_categorical_crossentropy.
The model achieved 87% accuracy.

**Dependencies**
SmartECG relies on the following dependencies:

Python 3.11
TensorFlow
Scikit-learn
OpenCV

Ensure these dependencies are installed before running the application.
