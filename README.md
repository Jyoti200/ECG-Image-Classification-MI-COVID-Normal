# SmartECG
A Comprehensive Approach to Automated Classification of Cardiac and COVID-19 Patients Using 12-Lead ECG Images – Integrating Machine Learning, Deep Neural Network, Convolutional Neural Network

## 📌 Overview
This project classifies ECG images into 5 categories: Myocardial Infarction (MI), COVID-19, History of Myocardial Infarction, Abnormal heartbeat and Normal using deep learning.

## 🚀 Features
- Uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification
- Trained on the data [https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/gwbz3fsgp8/1]
- Flask web app for easy image upload and prediction

## 🔧 Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repo:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Jyoti200/ECG-Image-Classification-MI-COVID-Normal.git
   cd ECG-Image-Classification-MI-COVID-Normal
🏆 Model Performance
